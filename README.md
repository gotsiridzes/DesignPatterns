# Design Patterns
Design patterns implementation in C# programming language.

# SOLID Design Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle
A Class should have only one reason to change.
Separation of concerns - different classes handle different, independent tasks/problems.

## Open-Closed Principle
States that parts of application should be open for extension and closed for modification. 
For example add more filters without going back to filter class.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
Should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.

## Interface Segregation Principle
Don't put too much into an interface. Split into separate interfaces.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

High level modules shouldn't depend on low level parts of application.
They should depend on some kind of abstraction.
